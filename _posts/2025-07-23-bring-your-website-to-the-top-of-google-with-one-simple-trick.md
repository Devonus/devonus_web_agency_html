We already know you need a website in 2025. It’s your central hub. The glue that holds your internet presence together.

Let’s face it though. What’s the point if people can’t even find your website?

You don’t need to be a web expert, SEO guru, or even a rocket scientist to climb the Google ranks! Fix your content’s search intent and you will beat your competitors.

You’re probably asking “what the fuck is that?”

Let me explain.

If your page doesn’t match what people are _trying_ to look for, Google will skip right over you as a suggestion. It doesn’t matter how many backlinks or keywords you’ve used.

Match Search Intent Perfectly

**Open an incognito tab** and search for the phrase you want to rank for. Look at the top results and ask yourself: What kind of pages are ranking? Are they how-to articles? Lists? Guides?

**Match that content**. If Google is ranking how-to articles, why would you write a product page?

**Change that content to match your brand**.

## WHY DOES THIS WORK?

These sites are already proven to work, so why not emulate that? You’re not copying, youre just aligning your content to match what Google thinks should rank.

Those top results aren’t random. They’ve been picked apart by experts. Experts that you don’t have at your disposal.

Learn from the best, then add your own twist to it.
