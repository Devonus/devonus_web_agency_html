# How to Choose the Right Web Agency for Your Business
**{{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}**

Are you looking to hire a web agency that can bring your online presence to new levels? With so many options to choose from, the process can be a bit overwhelming. Take a moment to define the success you’re looking for. Are you looking for a sleek and modern design? Do you want a seamless mobile experience? These are just some of the questions you need to be asking before looking for the best web agency that will fit your brand.

Here at Devonus we have a basic checklist to help you compare potential partners:

1. Budget & Pricing Transparency
2. Portfolio of Past Clients
3. Technology
4. Communication & Ongoing Support
5. Process Alignment

Let’s go over some of these.

## **Budget & Pricing Transparency**

Lets think about your budget. How much are you willing to spend to stand out from the crowd? Finding the ultra-low bid will often give you ultra-low results. Depending on the agency, some will bill by project, hourly, or monthly rates. Ensure you fully understand the costs you are signing up for so you don’t miss any hidden fees. Ask for a proposal that breaks down the design, development, and hosting.

## **Portfolio of Past Clients**

You wouldn’t hire a builder who hasn’t built a house right? So why would you hire a web agency that hasn’t built a website? A strong portfolio is more than just a beautiful screenshot, its a case study of how an agency tackled a real-world problem.

## **Technology**

The best web agency will choose tools that suit with your goals. Security, balance, and flexibility, ease of maintenance might all be things to ask about and how the agency will address those. Are you looking to manage all of the hosting, domain, DNS settings or would you rather have an experienced web agency take care of those while you manage your business? These are all questions you need to ask yourself. At Devonus, we take care of the hosting, deployments, and security updates so you only focus on the things important to you.

## **Communication & Ongoing Support**

Just like a car, maintenance is important on a website. Building the website is just a small part of the presence. Continuously updating your website post launch helps reach new audience members. Performance audits, feature enhancements, security updates are all essential to keeping your website up and appearing on Google. Keeping your website healthy shows potential clients that you are active and growing.

## **Cultural Fit & Process Alignment**

Cultural fit can play a vital role in choosing your web development team. Take the time during discovery calls to ensure the web agency knows what you want. A good web agency will get you what you want, but a great web agency will refine your wants and needs and even suggest options you haven’t thought of.

Ultimately, finding the right web agency isn’t about checking all of the boxes, it’s about finding a partner that understands your vision and growth. At Devonus, we aren’t here to just build you a website, we want to help you evolve your digital presence.
