# How to Write an LLMs.txt File: The New Standard for AI in 2025
**{{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}**

If the last decade of SEO was about optimizing for Google, the next decade is about building authority and trust for AI search engines. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek are now pulling live data from websites and citing them in responses. 

There's only one issue, most websites aren't LLM-friendly. Large language models struggle to interpret bloated HTML, ads, javascript-heavy pages or unstructured content. 

Here's where LLMs.txt comes in. This is a new standard that allows websites to communicate directly with AI crawlers and interface systems. If you are familiar with robots.txt or sitemap.xml, you already know why LLMs.txt will be extremely important in finding structured content.

We'll break down a few things in this post, particularly:
- what an LLMs.txt file is
- why LLMs.txt matters for AI SEO and citations
- A step by step guide on how to write an LLMs.txt
- best practicies, real examples, and common mistakes to avoid

Let's get started.

## What is LLMs.txt?

The LLMx.txt file is a simple markdown file that is places at the root of your website, similar to robots.txt and sitemap.xml. It provides AI-friendly summaries, context, and links to structured resources so that large language models can find them quickely and reference them for content.

robots.txt - tels crawlers what not to read
sitemap.xml - tells search engines where your pages are
LLMs.txt - tells AI agents what matters most on your website

For businesses, that means:
You can get citations in AI search engines
You can help mitigate interpretations of your content
It provides improved discoverability in AI-driven workflows

## Why LLMs.txt Matters for Business

Let's face it: AI-first discovery is already happening. SEO optimization will no longer just be about Google rankings. According to research:

- 30-40% of Gen Z and millennials ask AI first before searching Google
- AI search engines are growing at double-digit rates on a monthly basis
- LLMs are increasingly integrating into environments, workflows, and search assistants.

Without an LLMs.txt in your website, you risk being misunderstood by AI, getting ignored in answers where competitors are being referenced, being hidden due to bloated code. 

An LLMs.txt will allow you to curate what AI sees and references.

## How to Write an LLMs.txt File

Let's show you the basics of a LLMs.txt flow:

1. Place the File at Root
your LLMs.txt must live at 
```
https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt
```
This allows you to be discoverable. 

2. Start with a Project Title
Use an H1 (#) to clearly state what your site is.

## Best Practices for LLMs.txt
make sure to keep the information concise. AI doesn't need your whole website, the essentials are enough.
Use markdown consistently. Keep the formatting clear.
Prioritize canonical content. link to documentation or official sources.
Update it regularly. Just like SEO, stale content is bad content.
