You should be changing and updating your website constantly. Just like a car or a phone, it requires regular maintenance and updates to stay secure and support your business goals. That’s why it is so important to have a monthly website maintenance plan.


It does not matter what platform your website is on. Ignoring maintenance can lead to performance issues, broken functionality, security vulnerabilities, and a drop in SEO. Let’s go over why regular website checkups are essential and how it saves you time, money, and headaches in the long run.


## **Security Updates are your First Line of Defense**
Wordpress is notoriously known to have exploits that allow hackers to infiltrate your website because owners do not update them. Themes and plugins need security patches regularly so your website doesn’t become a target. A successful hack can completely compromise your data and brand reputation. Take a look at your website and see what updates are needed.


## **Regular Database Backups**<br>
Does your website hold information that you need for your business? Email address that you want to capture for leads? What happens if the database fails with no backup? No system is safe and it’s important to have automated backups for your site. This ensures that if anything goes wrong, your site can safely be restored within hours and not days.


## **Performance Checks**<br>
Did you know that potentials costumers will judge your company based on the design of your website? They will also leave and go to a competitor’s website if yours is too slow. A fast website not only keeps customers happy, but Google too. Sluggish load times and a poor user experience will hurt your SEO. Ensure you optimize image sizes, remove unused scripts, and scale your website for all screen sizes.


## **Update Your Site for Better SEO**<br>
search engines reward websites that are fast, stay online, don’t have broken links, outdated sitemaps, and backlinks. A monthly maintenance plan will ensure your site is always accessible, 404 errors and broken links are fixed or kept at a minimum, XML sitemaps are kept current, SEO is updated regularly. Want to improve your SEO even more? Start getting backlinks and increase your content. Blogging regularly can increase your SEO rankings by as much as 434% with 55% more website visits than those without blogs.


## **Maintaining Your Site Will Cause Less Breakage**<br>
Have you ever had to deal with updating your site that hasn’t been updated in a couple of years? It can be a real challenge. With so many continuous changes in the world of tech, plugins and layouts are forever evolving and breaking. Experienced developers will keep your site in a staging environment, make updates there and ensure it’s working before pushing it out to the world. This minimizes risk and ensures your site stays up and running.


## **Peace Of Mind**<br>

Maintaining your site is the freedom of not worrying. You can have the confidence of someone watching over your site while you focus on the things that are important for your business. Someone else is optimizing it, securing it, and responding quickly to any issues that arise.

Whether you’re a small business owner or entrepreneur, regular website support services are a smart investment. Just to give you an idea, websites that take too long to load costs companies 2.6 billion dollars each year in lost sales. Imagine losing a sale solely because your website was running a couple seconds slower than it normally does. Don’t let that be you.
