# AI SEO Services: How Brands Can Win Citations in AI Search Engines

<br>
## What is AI SEO and how does it differ from traditional SEO? 
The way we search is changing.

Traditional SEO relied on ranking on Google to get you better hits and more customers. 

AI SEO services focus on getting your brand cited inside of AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Deepseek, and more. 

These platforms don't show links, they summarize answers and reference those sources. If your company appears in one of those cited sources, it's an immediate trust signal.

At Devonus Web Agency, we help clients not only rank on Google for traditional SEO, we also aim to get you visible inside of AI search engines.

## Why Does AI SEO Matter for your brand in 2025?


## 60 Billion prompts a month are now being issues across AI search engines.
Yes you read that right, 60 BILLION.

That's 2 billion daily AI queries. and It's increasing. 

Buyers are researcing using AI before they even search on Google. 

This is a massive opportunity for your company. If it's cited in AI searched, it has the potential to be shown to millions of people. You will stand out in front of your competitors. 

## How do we Track AI SEO Analytics?
One of the biggest issues in AI SEO is that AI search engines don't have normal dashboards like other analytics like Google. That's where we come in.


1. Research and Strategy
- We do Market and Competitor citation audits
- prompt testing to see how LLMs answer industry questions
- keyword and AI query clustering for high-intent opportunities

2. Technical AI SEO optimization
- we set up your LLMs.txt for you to guide AI crawlers
- we set up structured data and Schema for AI crawlers
- we do website performance, crawlability and UX improvements

3. Content and Asset Production
- AI citation ready blog articles, landing pages, and product breakdowns
- Q&A, TL;DR and semantic structures that LLMs prefer
- Internal linking and content clustering to signal authority
- backlinking from domains already cited by AI

4. Analytics & Ongoing Optimzation
- AI citation tracking dashboards
- Session behaior analysis of AI-referred traffic
- generative search reporting
- iterative content testing with real AI prompts


## What Results can you expect from AI SEO Services?

Most companies will start to see AI visibility withing 2-3 months. Consistent ChatGPT citations and improved Google rankings will occur generally within 6-12 months. 

We don't just execute AI SEO tactics, we measure and prove what's working with analytics that track AI citations.

We fill in our clients on what prompts lead to citations, where competitors are outperforming, which formats are LLM-friendly, how AI visibility correlates with actual conversions. 

## Why Should you partner with an AI SEO web agency instead of doing it Yourself?
AI SEO is a very new and experimental field. Most in-house teams have never attempted to track AI search visibility, let alone optimze for it.

We bring a balance of SEO fundamentals and AI-specific optimzation, we understand the tech involved, how to stay ahead of LLM updates, and we allow clients to skip the trial-and-error phase and focus on fundamental SEO and AI SEO growth. 


We believe that SEO requires a multi-channel approach:

Google SEO for traffic

AI SEO for authority, trust and early-stage discover.

We can help you track, measure and grow in all SEO.
