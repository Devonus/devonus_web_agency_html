# AI SEO Services: How Brands Can Win Citations in AI Search Engines

<br>
## What is AI SEO and how does it differ from traditional SEO? 
The way we search is changing.

Traditional SEO relied on ranking on Google to get you better hits and more customers. 

AI SEO services focus on getting your brand cited inside of AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Deepseek, and more. 

These platforms don't show links, they summarize answers and reference those sources. If your company appears in one of those cited sources, it's an immediate trust signal.

At Devonus Web Agency, we help clients not only rank on Google for traditional SEO, we also aim to get you visible inside of AI search engines.

## Why Does AI SEO Matter for your brand in 2025?


## 60 Billion prompts a month are now being issues across AI search engines.
Yes you read that right, 60 BILLION.

That's 2 billion daily AI queries. and It's increasing. 

Buyers are researcing using AI before they even search on Google. 

This is a massive opportunity for your company. If it's cited in AI searched, it has the potential to be shown to millions of people. You will stand out in front of your competitors. 

## How do we Track AI SEO Analytics?
One of the biggest issues in AI SEO is that AI search engines don't have normal dashboards like other analytics like Google. That's where we come in. We have a LLM visibility audit that shows which prompts lead to ChatGPT LLM visibility audit showing which prompts lead to ChatGPT citations, which sources are referenced, and how company is positioned.







Here’s what our AI SEO services include:

1. Research & Strategy

Market and competitor citation audit.

Prompt testing to see how LLMs answer industry questions.

Keyword + AI query clustering for high-intent opportunities.

Funnel mapping for both SEO and LLM SEO.

2. Technical AI SEO Optimization

LLMs.txt setup to guide AI crawlers.

Structured data & schema for machine parsing.

Website performance, crawlability, and UX improvements.

3. Content & Asset Production

AI citation-ready blog articles, landing pages, and product breakdowns.

Q&A, TL;DR, and semantic structures that LLMs prefer.

Internal linking and content clustering to signal authority.

Source-based backlinking from domains already cited by AI.

4. Analytics & Ongoing Optimization

AI citation tracking dashboards (prompt-level).

Session behavior analysis of AI-referred traffic.

Generative search reporting (citations, inclusions, drop-offs).

Iterative content testing with real AI prompts.

What results can clients expect from AI SEO services?

Most SaaS and Fintech companies begin seeing early AI visibility within 2–3 months. Full-scale results, including consistent ChatGPT citations and improved Google rankings, generally occur within 6–12 months.

The difference with our agency is that we don’t just execute AI SEO tactics—we measure and prove what’s working with analytics that track AI citations in real time.

This gives our clients clarity on:

Which prompts lead to citations.

Where competitors are outperforming.

Which content formats are most LLM-friendly.

How AI visibility correlates with actual conversions.

Why partner with an AI SEO agency instead of handling it in-house?

AI SEO is a new, experimental field. Most in-house teams don’t have the tools or frameworks to track AI search visibility, let alone optimize for it.

Our agency solves this by bringing:

Proprietary AI search analytics tools.

A proven framework tested across SaaS and Fintech industries.

A balance of SEO fundamentals + AI-specific optimization.

A research-driven approach to stay ahead of constant LLM updates.

This allows our clients to skip the trial-and-error phase and focus on measurable AI SEO growth.

Final Thoughts: The Future of SEO is Multi-Channel

Google is still critical. But AI search engines are becoming just as important. The brands that invest in AI SEO services today will gain a first-mover advantage, owning citations and visibility before competitors even realize what’s happening.

At our agency, we believe the future of SEO is multi-channel:

Google SEO for traffic.

AI SEO for trust, authority, and early-stage discovery.

And with our AI SEO analytics system, SaaS and Fintech companies can finally track, measure, and grow in both worlds.

✅ Takeaway: Traditional SEO shows you rankings. AI SEO shows you citations.
We help you win both.
