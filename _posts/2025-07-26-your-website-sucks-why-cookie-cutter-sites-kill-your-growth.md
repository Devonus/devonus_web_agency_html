Congrats on launching your website! You’re expecting leads, but get crickets. Now what? There are millions of websites. What makes yours special? Let’s figure out why your site is failing:


1. **No Analytics, No Direction**

   1. Do you even know how many people are visiting your site?
   2. You don’t even have Google Analytics set up?

   <br>

2. **How Do You Expect Gold-Medal Results on a Participation Trophy Strategy?**

   1. You built the website, you’ve done nothing else
   2. You’re not adding content, you have no conversion funnel, no KPI targets
   3. You don’t even map your user journey

   <br>

3. **Stop Ghosting Your Blog Like A Bad Date, Show Up and Write Content**

   1. New content boosts your SEO and authority!
   2. No blog means no keyword rankings and no organic traffic
   3. Every unposted article, good or bad, is a potential lead you missed out on

   <br>

4. **Don’t Fail Your Company By Looking Like Everyone Else. Ditch Cookie Cutter Websites!**

   1. Your competitors are using the same exact design as you
   2. Visitors have no idea what company they’re looking at
   3. Unique branding lets users know you care about your image

   <br>

5. **No Investment = No Results**

   1. You need to update your website constantly
   2. Content creation, monthly SEO, and A/B testing cost time and money
   3. No ad budget? No paid channels? Expect limited reach

   <br>

6. **If You Ignore Customer Experience, Customers Will Ignore You**

   1. Slow pages will kill the customer experience
   2. Lighthouse audits and Core Web Vitals are important
